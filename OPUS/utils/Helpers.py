    Insert flattened launch values into the appropriate slices of the lam_vector,

    This is specifically for multi_species, when the index of the species does not fit

    Parameters:
        lam_vector (np.ndarray): The full lambda vector to modify (in-place).
        launches (np.ndarray): Flat array of launches, ordered by species.
        multi_species (object): An object with a .species list, where each species
                                has .start_slice and .end_slice attributes.
